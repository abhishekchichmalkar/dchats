When we wanted to buy a product like a watch on the internet, then suddenly we see ads related to the product on Facebook, Instagram, Google, etc this means they are accessing our every information even the messages we send to people on the Internet. There is a growing suspicion that web is betraying and spying in us.

Decentralized is the way to resolve this problem, itâ€™s an internet hosted via peer-to-peer network. The information will be distributed and stored around the world on multiple devices like phones, laptop, and even smart appliances. To achieve this, we are using [GUN](https://gun.eco/), a decentralized graph database which is Realtime, Low latency, and also has security, encryption and authorization for the data.
